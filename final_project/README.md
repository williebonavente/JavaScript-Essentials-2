4. **Interactive Menu**:  
   - User-friendly menu options powered by `readline` or `inquirer`.

5. **Error Handling**:  
   - Graceful handling of invalid inputs and unexpected errors.
   - Debugging tools to assist development and testing.

6. **Persistence**:  
   - Data stored locally using JSON files for user credentials and transactions.

## **Technical Details**
### **Project Architecture**
The project is modularized into the following components:

1. **`userAuth.js`**:  
   Handles user authentication, including login and registration.  
   **Key Functions**:  
   - `login(username, password)`  
   - `register(username, password)`  

2. **`budgetManager.js`**:  
   Manages core budget operations like adding transactions and summarizing data.  
   **Key Functions**:  
   - `addTransaction(transactions, transaction)`  
   - `getSummary(transactions)`  

3. **`transaction.js`**:  
   Manages transaction-related operations.  
   **Key Functions**:  
   - `deleteTransaction(transactions, id)`  
   - `listTransactions(transactions)`  

4. **`cliManager.js`**:  
   Handles user interactions through the command line interface.  
   **Key Functions**:  
   - `showMenu()`  
   - `promptUserInput(promptText)`  
   - `handleCommand(command)`  

5. **`helpers.js`**:  
   Utility functions for validation, formatting, and ID generation.  
   **Key Functions**:  
   - `validateInput(input, type)`  
   - `formatCurrency(amount)`  
   - `generateId()`  

---

## **Execution Flow**
1. **User Authentication**:
   - Prompt the user to log in or register.
   - Validate credentials using `async/await`.

2. **Interactive Menu**:
   - Present options like "Add **Transaction**," "View Transactions," or "View Summary."
   - Handle commands dynamically based on user input.

3. **Transaction Management**:
   - Collect transaction details (description, amount, type) through prompts.
   - Update JSON data and display real-time summaries.

4. **Budget Summary**:
   - Calculate and display total income, total expenses, and remaining budget.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Validate all inputs for correctness.
   - Display meaningful error messages for invalid operations.

## **Tips for Development**
1. **Start Simple**:  
   Begin with core functionalities like user authentication and transaction management. Expand incrementally.

2. **Test Frequently**:  
   - Use a testing framework like Jest to ensure functions work as expected.  
   - Test edge cases like invalid inputs and empty data files.

3. **Debugging**:  
   - Use `console.log()` statements for tracking execution flow.  
   - Leverage browser or Node.js debugging tools for troubleshooting.

4. **Enhance Interaction**:  
   - Use the `inquirer` library for intuitive prompts and menus.  
   - Include confirmation dialogs for critical actions like deleting transactions.

5. **Error Handling**:  
   - Validate inputs to prevent application crashes.  
   - Use `try-catch` blocks for file I/O operations.

## **Future Enhancements**
- **Data Encryption**: Secure sensitive data like user credentials using hashing techniques.
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Allow users to manage transactions in different currencies.
- **Analytics**: Provide insights like spending trends and monthly savings.
